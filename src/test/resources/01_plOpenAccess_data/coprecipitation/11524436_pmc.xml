      <abstract>
        <p>Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that Eps8 is involved in the routing of signals from Ras to Rac. This is achieved through the formation of a tricomplex consisting of Eps8&#x2013;E3b1&#x2013;Sos-1, which is endowed with Rac guanine nucleotide exchange activity. The catalytic subunit of this complex is represented by Sos-1, a bifunctional molecule capable of catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras and Rac. The mechanism by which Sos-1 activity is specifically directed toward Rac remains to be established. Here, by performing a structure&#x2013;function analysis we show that the Eps8 output function resides in an effector region located within its COOH terminus. This effector region, when separated from the holoprotein, activates Rac and acts as a potent inducer of actin polymerization. In addition, it binds to Sos-1 and is able to induce Rac-specific, Sos-1&#x2013;dependent guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Finally, the Eps8 effector region mediates a direct interaction of Eps8 with F-actin, dictating Eps8 cellular localization. We propose a model whereby the engagement of Eps8 in a tricomplex with E3b1 and Sos-1 facilitates the interaction of Eps8 with Sos-1 and the consequent activation of an Sos-1 Rac&#x2013;specific catalytic ability. In this complex, determinants of Eps8 are responsible for the proper localization of the Rac-activating machine to sites of actin remodeling.</p>

  <body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Small GTPases function as critical relays in the transduction of signals originating from membrane receptors by cycling between inactive GDP&#x2013; and active GTP&#x2013;bound states. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus controlling the rate and timing of activation of small GTPases. The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), resulting in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, is one of the best characterized pathways controlled by these molecular switches. Active ligand&#x2013;engaged RTKs signal to a critical small GTPase, Ras, which in turn activates another small GTPase, Rac. Finally, active GTP&#x2013;bound Rac is directly responsible for molecular events leading to actin remodeling (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar-Sagi and Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scita et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms of this cascade are being elucidated. Biochemical and genetic studies have shown how the Son of Sevenless (Sos)-1 GEF transduces the signal from active RTKs to Ras (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Sagi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schlessinger, 2000</xref>). Sos-1 interacts with the SH3-containing adaptor molecule Grb2. Grb2 in turn displays an SH2 domain responsible for the recruitment of the Grb2&#x2013;Sos-1 complex to active, autophosphorylated RTKs. The relocalization of the complex to the plasma membrane is thought to be sufficient for Sos-1 to catalyze the exchange of guanine nucleotides on Ras, which is also present at the plasma membrane.</p><p>How Ras signals to Rac is less understood. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-K) binds directly to Ras-GTP and it is required for activation of Rac (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997</xref>). In hematopoietic cells, the product of PI3-K's catalytic activity, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3), contributes through direct binding to the activation of a Rac-specific GEF, Vav-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Das et al., 2000</xref>). In nonhematopoietic cells, the lack of expression of Vav-1 indicates that other GEFs must be involved. Indeed, two recently identified members of the Vav family, Vav2 and Vav3, display ubiquitous expression and have been implicated in RTK-mediated actin remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schuebel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu and Burridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moores et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trenkle et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Sos-1 was also implicated in Ras-to-Rac signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nimnual et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>). Sos-1 was shown to participate in vivo in a tricomplex with two signaling molecules, Eps8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fazioli et al., 1993</xref>) and E3b1 (also known as Abi-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biesova et al., 1997</xref>). E3b1 contains an SH3 domain that mediates its binding to Sos-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fan and Goff, 2000</xref>). In addition, E3b1 binds to the SH3 domain of Eps8, thus acting as a scaffold protein which holds together Sos-1 and Eps8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biesova et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mongiovi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>). The tricomplex Sos-1&#x2013;E3b1&#x2013;Eps8 displays Rac GEF activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, Sos-1 might be endowed with a dual GEF activity, for Ras and Rac, respectively. At the molecular level, this is mirrored by the presence of two GEF domains in Sos-1: (a) a Cdc25-like domain, responsible for activity on Ras, and (b) a DH-PH tandem domain, a hallmark of GEFs for Rho GTPases, the subfamily to which Rac belongs. However, purified Sos-1 does not display Rac-GEF activity, whereas Ras-GEF activity could be readily detected. Thus, a coherent picture of how Sos-1 regulates Rac activation is still missing. Another unresolved question concerns the mechanism responsible for the proper compartmentalization of Sos-1 to sites where the Rac-based actin polymerizing machinery needs to be active. In this study, we provide evidence that Eps8 is a critical factor in the regulation of both these functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of a COOH-terminal &#x201C;effector region&#x201D; of Eps8 capable of inducing actin polymerization into ruffles</title><p>The biochemical function of Eps8, which mediates Ras to Rac signaling, leading to actin cytoskeleton reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2000</xref>), is mirrored by its subcellular localization.

  A). A substantial relocalization of Eps8 occurs upon treatment with growth factors within sites of actin polymerization, at the dorsal surface of cells, and in membrane ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Provenzano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The COOH-terminal region (535&#x2013;821) of Eps8 is necessary and sufficient for Eps8 localization to the cell cortex and its accumulation into PDGF-induced membrane ruffles.</bold> (A) Mouse embryo fibroblasts were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml of PDGF (+PDGF) for 10 min or mock treated (&#x2212;PDGF).

After serum starvation, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of PDGF (+PDGF) for 10 min or mock treated (&#x2212;PDGF), followed by fixation and detection of GFP-Eps8 fusion proteins by epifluorescence.

A GFP full length Eps8 (amino acids 1&#x2013;821) displayed a sub-cellular localization indistinguishable from that of the endogenous protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). In contrast, a NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment (amino acids 1&#x2013;535) showed a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining unaltered by treatment with growth factors, suggesting that the COOH terminus contains residues important for Eps8 localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Accordingly, a COOH-terminal fragment (amino acids 535&#x2013;821) displayed intense localization along the cell cortex within structures reminiscent of ruffles. These structures corresponded to sites of actin polymerization (not shown; see also <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>)
 
 . The differential cellular localization of the Eps8 mutants was not due to the GFP moiety, since GFP alone was diffusely distributed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (not shown). Furthermore, similar levels of expression of the various Eps8 constructs were obtained, as determined by immunoblotting (not shown) and immunofluorescence analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). Thus, our data indicate that determinants in the COOH terminus are responsible for the subcellular localization of Eps8.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the minimal effector region of Eps8 capable of inducing actin polymerization into ruffles.</bold> (A) Schematic of the various Eps8 fragments, all engineered as GFP fusion proteins (amino acid boundaries are given on the left of the constructs.

In serum-starved mouse embryo fibroblasts, where the actin cytoskeleton is organized in a flat array of stress fibers, the expression of this mutant caused reorganization of F-actin into dorsal and membrane ruffles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B). This effect could also be observed in different cell lines (Cos-7, NIH-3T3, HeLa; not shown). Thus, the COOH terminus of Eps8 is responsible not only for proper localization of the protein, but it also displays an &#x201C;effector&#x201D; function, capable of inducing actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the absence of growth factor stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of the effector region of Eps8</title><p>We engineered a series of deletion mutants of Eps8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A) fused to GFP. A mutant, 586&#x2013;821, lacking the SH3 domain retained ruffling activity in the absence of growth factor treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), indicating that the SH3 domain of Eps8 is dispensable for actin reorganization activity in the absence of growth factors. Thus, an interaction with E3b1, mediated by the SH3 domain of Eps8, is not required for the effector function of the COOH-terminal fragment of Eps8.</p><p>Further deletions of the COOH terminus of Eps8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>) showed that the minimal region required to elicit ruffling spanned amino acids 648&#x2013;821. Interestingly, this region is also the minimal region required for colocalization with polymerized actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Indeed, for all the Eps8 mutants containing this region, there was perfect correlation between ruffling activity and colocalization with phalloidin-stained F-actin (or lack of both events; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Notably, the Eps8 effector region, similarly to the known inducer of actin polymerization such as activated Rac and PI3-K, induces prominent peripheral ruffles, but only rarely circular ruffles. These latter structures are dependent on PDGF stimulation, pointing to the requirement of additional signaling events, whose nature remains undetermined.</p><p>The ruffle-inducing activity of the Eps8 effector region was recorded in real time. The GFP effector region of Eps8 (586&#x2013;821) rapidly induced and accumulated within dynamic structures along the dorsal area and the leading edge of cells, thus confirming the observations obtained in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. Furthermore, it relocalized in protruding lamellipodia of spreading and moving cells, suggesting its involvement in migratory processes (supplementary information). Thus, Eps8 is endowed with a potent and constitutive ruffle-inducing activity residing in its 173 COOH-terminal amino acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Signaling by the effector region of Eps8</title><p>Ras and Rho GTPases establish a signaling network that regulates actin rearrangement (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar-Sagi and Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scita et al., 2000</xref>), a process in which the participation of PI3-K has also been firmly established (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1997</xref>). To define the site of action of the effector region of Eps8 in the signaling pathways leading to actin remodeling, we attempted to interfere with its function with a series of molecular and pharmacological inhibitors. In particular, we used dominant negative versions of Ras (RasN17), Cdc42 (Cdc42N17), Rho (RhoN19), PI3-K (p85&#x394;iSH2), and Rac (586-821). We also used the PI3-K&#x2013;specific inhibitor, wortmannin.</p><p>Upon microinjection in mouse fibroblasts, all the dominant negative mutants were readily expressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>)

The minimal region capable of interacting with Sos-1 extended from amino acids 648 to 821, thus coinciding with the region required for the biological activity of the effector domain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). The interaction was likely direct, since GST-Eps8 (648&#x2013;821) was able to bind, albeit with low stoichiometry, to native, eukaryotically produced, and purified (&gt;90% purity) Sos-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). However, it cannot be formally excluded that copurified proteins tightly associated to Sos-1 might be responsible for the observed interaction.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> B, the effector region of Eps8, when alone, bound to purified Sos-1 at least 10-fold better than full length GST-Eps8. The marginal binding of full length GST-Eps8 might reflect the true ability of the holoprotein to interact with Sos-1 or an artifactual situation. Under this latter scenario, one could postulate that in vivo Eps8 does not bind to Sos-1 unless determinants in its COOH terminus are unmasked: a setting mimicked by the enucleation of the effector region from the holoprotein, or by partial unfolding of the bacterially expressed Eps8 full length molecule. To gain insight into this issue we studied the association in vivo of Sos-1 with either the effector region of Eps8 or with the holoprotein. Native Sos-1 could be efficiently recovered in HA-tagged Eps8 (586&#x2013;821) immunoprecipitates of cells double transfected with Sos-1 and HA-Eps8 (586&#x2013;821) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C). No E3b1 could be detected in the same immunoprecipitates, even under conditions of E3b1 overexpression (not shown). On the contrary, the in vivo association between Sos-1 and Eps8 was strictly E3b1-dependent. Indeed, native Sos-1 could be readily recovered in Eps8 immunoprecipitates from triple Sos-1&#x2013;E3b1&#x2013;Eps8 transfectants, but not when an Eps8 mutant, unable to bind E3b1 due to a deletion in its SH3 domain (Eps8&#x394;SH3), was used (Sos-1&#x2013;Eps8&#x394;SH3&#x2013;E3b1 transfectants), or when E3b1 was not transfected along with Sos-1 and Eps8 (Sos-1&#x2013;Eps8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> C).</p><p>We then tested whether the biological and biochemical activity of the Eps8 effector region could activate Sos-1 Rac&#x2013;specific GEF in vivo. First, a Rac-GEF assay was performed using lysates of cells expressing the effector domain of Eps8 or a ruffling-incompetent Eps8 fragment (586&#x2013;733) which cannot bind to Sos-1. Expression of the effector region, but not of the ruffling-incompetent fragment, induced a substantial increase in Rac-specific GEF activity in vivo over the basal control values (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). This effect was dependent on the presence of Sos-1 (or of another GEF, tightly associated to Sos-1), since no Rac-GEF activity could be detected in the same lysates upon immunodepletion of Sos-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> D). Second, we used in vitro assays that can score GEF activities in immunoprecipitates. Cells were transfected either with a construct containing the effector region, Eps8 (586&#x2013;821), or with a control construct, Eps8 (1&#x2013;535), alone or in combination with Sos-1. Rac-GEF activity could be readily detected when the Eps8 (586&#x2013;821) protein was immunoprecipitated from cells coexpressing Eps8 (586&#x2013;821) and Sos-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> E). Under these conditions, coimmunoprecipitation between Eps8 (586&#x2013;821) and Sos-1 was detected (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> E, bottom).

Both associations were confirmed by in vitro binding experiments (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> B).

This is in agreement with our previous work, which epistatically positioned Eps8 between Ras/PI3-K and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>). Biochemical evidence also supported a role of the Eps8 effector region in the activation of Rac. Its transient expression led to activation in vivo of Rac and PAK65. Moreover, the overexpression of the effector region of Eps8 increased the levels of Rac-specific GEF activities in the cell by a mechanism which was shown to be directly dependent on the presence of Sos-1 (or of Sos-1&#x2013;associated GEFs) and on the interaction between Sos-1 and the Eps8 effector region.</p><p>Thus, the effector region of Eps8 appears to signal in a manner indistinguishable from full length Eps8, albeit in a growth factor&#x2013;independent fashion. Indeed, we showed that the overexpression of the effector region, but not of the full length Eps8 protein, is sufficient to elicit actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Thus, within the context of the full length Eps8 protein, a tight regulation of the effector function must be at play and determinants contained in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half of Eps8 are predicted to exert an inhibitory role. This mode of action is remarkably reminiscent of that of Wasp and its homologue N-Wasp, which link multiple signaling pathways to actin assembly. N-Wasp interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and activates the ability of the latter to nucleate actin filaments (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mullins, 2000</xref>). A COOH-terminal domain of N-Wasp, the VCA domain, is sufficient when enucleated from the full length molecule to bind to the Arp2/3 complex and activate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mullins, 2000</xref>). Physiologically, however, activation of N-Wasp occurs when the molecule is stimulated by the proper set of upstream signals, including active Cdc42 and PIP2. These molecules bind cooperatively to N-Wasp and force it to adopt an open conformation, which exposes the VCA domain, allowing its effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rohatgi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Higgs and Pollard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prehoda et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In analogy to Wasp and N-Wasp, and based on our results, a model can therefore be proposed in which Eps8 that is normally inactive in the cell is activated by upstream signals and therefore rendered competent for activation of Rac. From our data, it appears that the key step in this series of events is the binding of the effector region of Eps8 to Sos-1. Indeed several activities, including Sos-1 binding, induction of Rac-specific GEFs and activation of Rac and Rac-dependent pathways, all cosegregated with the same fragment of Eps8. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that a latent, Rac-specific, GEF activity of Sos-1 is unmasked upon direct binding to the effector region of Eps8. In this scenario, the &#x201C;activation&#x201D; of Eps8 might correspond to a conformational change (or functionally equivalent mechanism), which renders its effector region available for direct interaction with Sos-1. A corollary of such a model is that full length Eps8 should not be able to bind to Sos-1 directly. Indeed, we show in this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scita et al., 1999</xref>) that association of Eps8 with Sos-1 is strictly dependent on the presence of the scaffolding molecule E3b1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). On the contrary, this latter molecule is not required for the interaction between the effector region of Eps8 and Sos-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, A&#x2013;C), which are readily coimmunoprecipitated in vivo. To validate this model, we are presently attempting to reconstitute in vitro a Rac-specific GEF complex by using purified E3b1&#x2013;Sos-1&#x2013;Eps8 or purified Sos-1&#x2013;Eps8 effector region.</p><p>Our model also provide clues as to how the Sos-1 Rac&#x2013;specific GEF activity is regulated under physiological conditions, within the context of a trimeric complex where E3b1 scaffolds together Eps8 and Sos-1. We note that the affinity of Sos-1 for the effector region of Eps8 is rather low. Thus, the scaffolding function of E3b1 might provide an efficient mechanism of increasing the local concentration of the two binders (Eps8 and Sos-1) for the purpose of achieving a stoichiometry of interaction sufficient for biological output. Under conditions of overexpression of the effector region (but not of full length Eps8, according to our model), this requirement might be bypassed simply by virtue of mass action. Of course, this model does not exclude that other events, in addition to the simple Eps8&#x2013;Sos-1 interaction, are required in vivo to activate the Rac-specific GEF function of Sos-1. One obvious level of regulation is the one exerted by growth factor stimulation, which might, among other effects, relieve the inhibition of Eps8. This could be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps8 or binding of phosphoinositides to the DH-PH domain of Sos-1 or to the PTB domain of Eps8. We are presently investigating these possibilities.</p><p>An additional level of regulation is highlighted by our findings of a physical direct interaction between Eps8 and F-actin, which mirrored the in vivo colocalization of Eps8 with F-actin&#x2013;containing structures. This function is also contained within the effector region of Eps8. We could not identify determinants within this region that would allow the dissection of the abilities to bind to F-actin or to Sos-1. This might be due to a high degree of overlap between the two surfaces. In this case, single amino acid mutations might be required to identify the residues responsible for each individual interaction. The effector region of Eps8 did not appear to be endowed with intrinsic actin-polymerizing activity. Thus, the most likely functional role of the Eps8&#x2013;F-actin interaction is that of directing Eps8 to sites where actin remodeling has to occur in response to extracellular stimuli. E3b1 and Sos-1 are also localized to F-actin&#x2013;containing structures after growth factor stimulation of intact cells, and therefore interaction of Eps8 with F-actin might dictate the relocalization of the Rac-activating trimeric complex Eps8&#x2013;E3b1&#x2013;Sos-1 to sites where its activity is required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Expression vectors and antibodies</title><p>All eukaryotic expression vectors were generated in cytomegalovirus promoter&#x2013;based constructs (pCDNA3, pCR3; In VitroGene).

Specifically bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by detection with silver staining. The protein bands of interest were excised from one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. After reduction and alkylation, proteins were digested &#x201C;in gel&#x201D; for 6 h at 37&#xB0;C with sequencing-grade trypsin (Boehringer). Samples for MALDI analysis were prepared by using the &#x201C;fast evaporation&#x201D; method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mann and Talbo, 1996</xref>). Mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager-DE STR BioSpectrometry workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems). Matrix-related ions and trypsin autolysis products were used for internal calibration. The peptide mass accuracy was &gt;30 ppm (on average). The ProFound-Peptide Mapping software (Rockefeller University edition, v4.10.5) was used to search a nonredundant protein sequence database (searchable at the National Center for Biotechnology Information) with a list of peptide masses. The samples for MS/MS analysis were loaded onto a Poros R2 (PerSeptive Biosystems) microcolumm, desalted, and eluted into nanoelectrospray needles (Protana). Nanoelectrospray MS/MS analysis was performed on a quadrupole time-of-fight mass spectrometer (QSTAR; PerkinElmer).

Recombinant, purified GST fusion proteins (2 &#x3BC;M) were subsequently incubated with increasing concentration of F-actin in F-buffer for 45 min at 37&#xB0;C.

Equal amounts of starting material, supernatants, and pellets were solubilized in loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting using anti-GST and antiactin antibodies. The rate and the extent of actin polymerization in the presence of the Eps8 effector region was determined from the increase in fluorescence of pyrene actin that occurs when pyrene-labeled actin polymerizes, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Etten et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>For Sos-1 purification, total cellular lysates from 293T cells, transfected with HA epitope&#x2013;tagged Sos-1, were immunopurified onto an affinity column obtained by cross-linking anti-HA antibodies to immobilized protein G with dimethyl pimelidate dihydrochloride. After binding, the column was washed with the 10-bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 0.2% SDS. Bound Sos-1 was eluted with the peptide MYDVPDYAS, corresponding to the HA epitope tag. Sos-1 was &gt;90% pure, as assessed by calculating the percentage of Sos-1 with respect to the total amount of protein. This was determined by subjecting serial dilutions of the purified material to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue and compared with a standard curve of BSA. Similar results were obtained by comparing the intensity of the band corresponding to Sos-1 with the bands corresponding to contaminants and/or to Sos-1 degradation products.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Video 1 and Figure S1.
