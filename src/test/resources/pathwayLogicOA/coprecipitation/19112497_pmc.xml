      <abstract>
        <p>The adapter protein TRAF6 is critical for mediating signal transduction from members of the IL-1R/TLR and TNFR superfamilies. The TRAF6 RING finger domain functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase capable of generating non-degradative K63-linked ubiquitin chains. It is believed that these chains serve as docking sites for formation of signaling complexes, and that K63-linked autoubiquitination of TRAF6 is essential for formation and activation of a complex involving the kinase TAK1 and its adapters, TAB1 and TAB2. In order to assess independently the E3 ligase and ubiquitin substrate functions of TRAF6, we generated, respectively, RING domain and complete lysine-deficient TRAF6 mutants. We found that while the TRAF6 RING domain is required for activation of TAK1, it is dispensable for interaction between TRAF6 and the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. Likewise, lysine-deficient TRAF6 was found to interact with the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex, but surprisingly was also found to be fully competent to activate TAK1, as well as NF&#x3BA;B and AP-1 reporters. Furthermore, lysine-deficient TRAF6 rescued IL-1-mediated NF&#x3BA;B and MAPK activation, as well as IL-6 elaboration in retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts. Lysine-deficient TRAF6 also rescued RANKL-mediated NF&#x3BA;B and MAPK activation, and osteoclastogenesis in retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient bone marrow macrophages. While incapable of being ubiquitinated itself, we demonstrate that lysine-deficient TRAF6 remains competent to induce ubiquitination of IKK&#x3B3;/NEMO. Further, this NEMO modification contributes to TRAF6-mediated activation of NF&#x3BA;B. Collectively, our results suggest that while TRAF6 autoubiquitination may serve as a marker of activation, it is unlikely to underpin RING finger-dependent TRAF6 function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Non-conventional K63-linked ubiquitination has gained attention in recent years as a mechanism of protein scaffold building for complex formation during signal transduction. Upon activation, HECT or RING finger domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases affix these non-degradative ubiquitin chains to protein substrates, which then serve as recruitment platforms for downstream signaling mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lowe1">[2]</xref>. The close proximity of factors generated by these scaffolds is believed to promote otherwise energetically inefficient conformational adaptations or phosphorylation events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lowe1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Laine1">[3]</xref>. A particularly notable K63-specific RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase is TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which was identified as having such activity upon being isolated from an I&#x3BA;B kinase (IKK)-activating complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Deng1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wang1">[5]</xref>. Like most other TRAFs, TRAF6 is composed of an N-terminal RING finger domain, a series of zinc fingers, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal TRAF domain. TRAF6 is unique from other TRAFs in that it utilizes a distinct interaction motif, which is found in its upstream activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Ye1">[6]</xref>. As such, TRAF6 has been implicated in directing the signals from representative members of a diverse array of receptor families, including the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), IL-1R/Toll-like receptor superfamily (IL-1R/TLRSF), TGF&#x3B2;R, IL-17R and IL-25R, and the NOD-like pattern recognition receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Abbott1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lee1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Maezawa1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Schwandner1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Sorrentino1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Yamashita1">[13]</xref>. TRAF6 activation leads to downstream activation of PI3K, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and the transcription factor families NF&#x3BA;B, NFAT, and IRF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wu1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Takaoka1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Takayanagi1">[15]</xref>. Numerous biochemical and genetic studies have revealed mechanistic insights into TRAF6 utilization of ubiquitination to propagate diverse signals. To date, the most prominent model holds that upon activation via TRAF6 homo-oligimerization, the RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase domain complexes with a K63-specific E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc13/Uev1a, or possibly UbcH7) to mediate attachment of non-degradative K63-linked ubiquitin chains to TRAF6 substrates, specifically TRAF6 itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Deng1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Geetha1">[16]</xref>. These chains recruit factors, like the adapters TAB2/3, which contain atypical zinc finger domains with a special affinity for binding K63-linked ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Kanayama1">[17]</xref>. As part of a pre-formed complex, TAB2/3 bring TAB1 and the putative IKK and MKK kinase TAK1 to TRAF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wang1">[5]</xref>. It is believed that TAK1 is then activated via a trans-phosphorylation event made possible by the close proximity generated by complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Singhirunnusorn1">[18]</xref>. Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates downstream factors. However, the complexities involved in studying ubiquitin-mediated signaling events have made certain aspects of this model difficult to formally demonstrate. For instance, putative ubiquitin targets are often ubiquitinated with both K48-linked degradative and K63-linked non-degradative chains at multiple locations. A further complication is the propensity of ubiquitination complexes to generate chains of varying lengths at a given modification site <italic>in vivo</italic>, making detection of ubiquitination by traditional size separation techniques challenging. Attempts to genetically manipulate lysine acceptor sites on protein substrates with the intention of ablating E3 ligase-specific ubiquitination may result in dramatically decreased modification, while failing to entirely eliminate physiologically relevant ubiquitin chains that happen to be affixed at low levels or heterotypic lengths. Lastly, while autoubiquitination is often readily detected in the context of <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination, these assays feature a well-recognized caveat of increased E3 ligase promiscuity in the absence of alternative targets, such that the same autoubiquitination event observed <italic>in vitro</italic> may not have physiologic relevance <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Haglund1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-VanDemark1">[20]</xref>. Therefore, we sought to investigate, through genetic approaches, the relationship between TRAF6 RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, TRAF6 (auto)ubiquitination (for the purpose of clarity we will refer to all K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 as autoubiquitination, while recognizing that additional ubiquitin E3 ligases may be involved in TRAF6 K63-linked modification <italic>in vivo</italic>) and recruitment and activation of downstream signaling. We found that while the TRAF6 RING finger domain is required for activation of TAK1, it is dispensable for interaction between TRAF6 and the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. Surprisingly, we found that TRAF6 autoubiquitination was dispensable for both interaction with, and activation of, the TAK1 signaling complex. Further, TRAF6 autoubiquitination, but not RING finger function, was found to be dispensable for IL-1- or RANKL-dependent elaboration of IL-6, or osteoclastogenesis, respectively. Finally, TRAF6 autoubiquitination was found not to be required for TRAF6 to ubiquitinate an alternative target, specifically IKK&#x3B3; (NEMO).</p>

        <title>TRAF6 associates with the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the absence of a functional TRAF6 RING finger domain</title>
        <p>It has previously been demonstrated that TRAF6 RING finger function, K63-linked ubiquitination, and the ubiquitin-binding domain of TAB2 are required for TRAF6-mediated activation of downstream signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Kanayama1">[17]</xref>. It is believed that TRAF6 autoubiquitination serves as a point of recruitment for TAB2, and hence TAB1 and TAK1. If so, we reasoned that overexpression of a TRAF6 mutant possessing a defective RING finger (C70A), and therefore incapable of autoubiquitination, should not inhibit NF&#x3BA;B activation induced by co-overexpression of TAK1 and its activator, TAB1. Rather, in reporter assays for NF&#x3BA;B, we found that while overexpression of wild-type TRAF6 in conjunction with TAB1 and TAK1 enhanced reporter activity over TAB1 and TAK1 alone, overexpression of RING finger-mutant TRAF6 (C70A) caused a greater than 2-fold reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To assess the importance of the TRAF6 RING finger function to interaction with the TAK1 complex, we performed a co-immunoprecipiation assay, and found that another TRAF6 mutant containing a defective RING finger (C85A/H87A) interacted more strongly with TAK1 than did wild-type TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Like other TRAF proteins, TRAF6 forms homo- and heterotypic interactions via a C-terminal TRAF domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Baud1">[21]</xref>. To exclude the possibility that a full-length TRAF6 RING mutant might compensate for defective complex formation through interactions with endogenous TRAF proteins, we generated mutants in which the C-terminus of TRAF6 is replaced with the artificial oligomerization domain of bacterial Gyrase B. Again, we found that RING-mutant TRAF6 interacted as well, or better with TAB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), TAB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), and TAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Given that TRAF6 autoubiquitination requires a functional RING finger, these observations challenge the putative relationship between TRAF6 autoubiquitination and recruitment of the TAK1 signaling complex to TRAF6.</p>

        <title>A lysine-deficient TRAF6 N-terminus-Gyrase B fusion protein interacts with and activates TAK1, and induces NF&#x3BA;B and AP-1 reporter activity</title>
        <p>Like many E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRAF6 has the capacity to autoubiquitinate <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Deng1">[4]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004064.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Physiologic relevance of TRAF6 autoubiquitination has been inferred from the dual observations that 1) TRAF6 autoubiquitination is detected <italic>in vivo</italic> upon engagement of TRAF6-dependent receptors, and 2) the TRAF6 RING finger is required for propagating downstream signal transduction. Recent efforts have been made to map the lysines residue(s) on TRAF6 targeted during <italic>in vitro</italic> autoubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lamothe1">[22]</xref>. However, it remains unclear whether, or in what pattern, TRAF6 might combine with other K63-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases to ubiquitinate TRAF6 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we sought to divorce the RING finger function of TRAF6 from its capacity to serve as a substrate for ubiquitination. We employed a mutagenesis approach targeting individual lysine residues, which form isopeptide bonds with the carboxyl-terminal glycine 76 of ubiquitin, to ablate TRAF6 autoubiquitination during <italic>in vivo</italic> overexpression. However, we were only able to achieve partial reduction in ubiquitination, possibly due to modification of TRAF6 at multiple sites. Therefore, reasoning that we could focus on the N-terminus, due to its ability to activate downstream signaling when fused to Gyrase B, we simultaneously mutated all N-terminal TRAF6 lysine residues (K32-348) on both full-length and (1-358)-Gyrase B fusion versions of TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We tested the ability of the full-length TRAF6 (K32-348R) mutant to autoubiquitinate in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay and found that K63-specific modification of TRAF6 was reduced to a level similar to that of the TRAF6 RING finger mutant (C70A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). By utilizing the TRAF6(1-358)-Gyrase B mutant (&#x394;K) to assess interaction with TAK1 in 293T cells, we found that &#x394;K interacted with TAK1 more strongly than wild-type TRAF6, though less strongly than C70A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), demonstrating dispensability of TRAF6 autoubiquitination for complex formation with TAK1. In the IL-1 signaling pathway, optimal TAK1-mediated activation of JNK and NF&#x3BA;B requires phosphorylation of TAK1 at T187 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004064.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). To assess the ability of TRAF6 mutants to activate TAK1, we transfected low levels of TRAF6(1-358)-Gyrase B mutants and induced oligomerization using the drug Coumermycin A1. While all TRAF6 constructs exhibited interaction with TAK1 in the absence of drug, and only the RING mutant failed to activate TAK1 in the presence of drug, the &#x394;K mutant exhibited enhanced activation of TAK1 in comparison to wild-type TRAF6, even in the absence of drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that TRAF6 autoubiquitination may be dispensable for activation of TAK1-mediated signaling. The various TRAF6-Gyrase B mutants were then tested in reporter assays for NF&#x3BA;B and AP-1, and consistent with its apparent enhanced ability to activate TAK1, the &#x394;K mutant induced both NF&#x3BA;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) reporters to higher levels than wild-type TRAF6.</p>

        <title>A lysine-deficient mutant TRAF6 rescues IL-1-mediated NF&#x3BA;B and MAPK activation, as well as IL-6 production, in TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts</title>
        <p>To assess the requirement for TRAF6 autoubiquitination during physiologic receptor signaling, we generated TRAF6-deficient fibroblast cell lines retrovirally-rescued with either FLAG-tagged wild-type, RING finger mutant (C70A), or total lysine-deficient (K32-518R) TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation of these proteins was carried out, followed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay which demonstrated not only that neither C70A nor K32-518R could autoubiquitinate, but also that a mixture of the two was incapable of autoubiquitination in trans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), suggesting the importance of TRAF6 oligimerization for E3 ligase activity. IL-1R signaling in TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts is completely defective. <italic>In vivo</italic>, induction of high molecular weight TRAF6, in response to IL-1, treatment was detected in fibroblast cell lines expressing wild-type, but not C70A or K32-518R versions of TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), though <italic>in vivo</italic> expression levels of TRAF6 K32-518R were consistently much lower than those of wild-type TRAF6. Regardless, TRAF6 K32-518R was capable of activating the kinases TAK1 and IKK in response to IL-1 in a manner similar to wild-type TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). IL-1-dependent activation of the MAPKs JNK and p38, and phosphorylation and degradation of the NF&#x3BA;B inhibitor I&#x3BA;B&#x3B1; were also normal in TRAF6 K32-518R-rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). Though activation of these key downstream signaling pathways in the absence of TRAF6 autoubiquitination appeared normal, TRAF6-mediated gene regulation involves complex coordination of multiple transcription factor families, leaving the possibility that genetic regulation by TRAF6 K32-518R might be defective. To address this possibility, we assayed elaboration of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by retrovirally-rescued fibroblasts in response to IL-1 treatment, and found that while TRAF6 C70A failed to induce IL-6 production, TRAF6 K32-518R-rescued cells produced IL-6 at slightly higher levels than cells rescued with wild-type TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

        <title>Lysine-deficient TRAF6 N-terminus-Gyrase B fusion protein is competent to mediate TRAF6-specific ubiquitin modification of NEMO</title>
        <p>Substantial evidence exists for the general role of K63-linked ubiquitination in promoting TRAF6-mediated signal transduction, and while the TRAF6 RING finger domain is essential, the dispensability of TRAF6 autoubiquitination opened the possibility that the critical function of the RING domain is unrelated to ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Therefore, we sought to identify an example of TRAF6 RING-mediated ubiquitination that occurs independently of TRAF6 autoubiquitination. IKK&#x3B3;, the IKK regulatory component also known as NEMO, is ubiquitinated in response to TRAF6-dependent IL-1R/TLRSF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Abbott1">[7]</xref>, and has been shown to be a K63-linked target of TRAF6 E3 ligase activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lamothe1">[22]</xref>.

To determine the specificity of the NEMO modification, we co-transfected NEMO with either TRAF6, or various TRAF6-associated factors (TRAF2, TRAF5, constitutively-active IKK&#x3B2; (IKK&#x3B2;EE), TAK1/TAB1, MEKK3, ASK1) known to act downstream of, or parallel to, TRAF6-dependent signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chung1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Huang1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Mercurio1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Mochida1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Sakurai1">[28]</xref>. We found that despite the association of these various factors with NF&#x3BA;B reporter activation, only TRAF6 co-expression induced this distinct modification of NEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Having identified a clear TRAF6-inducible modification of NEMO, we sought to determine whether it required either the TRAF6 RING finger domain or ubiquitination of TRAF6. Using co-expression of NEMO with TRAF6(1-358)-Gyrase B fusion constructs containing either RING (C70A) or total lysine (&#x394;K) mutations, we found that while the RING finger was required for NEMO modification, TRAF6 autoubiquitination was dispensable. To confirm that the modification identified was in fact ubiquitination, we excised the modified band from a preparative gel and subjected it to nanoLC-MS/MS mass spectrometry, and identified an m/z signature consistent with ubiquitination at NEMO K285 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Abbott1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Perkins1">[29]</xref>.

IP extracts were dissociated from anti-Myc agarose by heating (65&#xB0;C) in non-reducing SDS-PAGE buffer, and separated from agarose by centrifugation. Reducing agent was added to IP extracts, and 10% of each was used for immunoblotting with anti-Myc to confirm the presence of NEMO modification (not shown), while 90% was run on a preparative gel and stained with colloidal coomassie blue (not shown). The NEMO modification band found in the lane co-transfected with wild-type, but not with C70A TRAF6(1-358)-Gyrase B, was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry.

        <title>TRAF6-associated ubiquitination of NEMO is required for optimal IL-1-mediated activation of NF&#x3BA;B</title>
        <p>Lack of a requirement for TRAF6 autoubiquitination in TRAF6 RING finger-dependent signaling suggests that alternative physiologic targets of TRAF6 E3 ligase activity must exist. To confirm the relevance of TRAF6-mediated NEMO ubiquitination to physiologic NF&#x3BA;B activation, we retrovirally rescued NEMO-deficient fibroblasts with wild-type or K285R NEMO and treated with IL-1.

To determine whether these signaling defects affected NF&#x3BA;B-dependent cytokine production, we assayed supernatant from the IL-1-treated fibroblasts for IL-6 production, and found a greater than 50% reduction in fibroblasts rescued with K285R as compared to wild-type NEMO. These observations suggest not only that TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of NEMO is physiologically relevant, but also that TRAF6-dependent signaling likely involves targets of TRAF6 E3 ligase activity beyond TRAF6 itself.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The non-conventional RING finger E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is critical for activating downstream signaling in the key inflammatory and developmental pathways IL-1R and RANK, respectively. TRAF6 autoubiquitination is commonly used as an activation marker for RING finger activity, and it is currently held that K63-linked ubiquitin chains on TRAF6 serve as a docking platform for downsteam mediators like TAK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chen1">[1]</xref>. In this context, the requirement for TRAF6 autoubiquitination per se has not been formally demonstrated. We attempted to do so by divorcing the RING finger function of TRAF6 from its ubiquitin substrate function. Surprisingly, we found that in the absence of TRAF6 autoubiquitination, IL-1- and RANKL-dependent signaling remained intact in the presence of a functional RING finger domain. Retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts elaborated IL-6 in response to IL-1, and retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient BMM developed into osteoclasts in response to RANKL, both independently of TRAF6 autoubiquitination. TRAF6 autoubiquitination was also found to be dispensable for TRAF6 RING finger-dependent ubiqutination of NEMO. Further, we found that neither TRAF6 autoubiquitination, nor the RING finger domain were required for TRAF6 interaction with the TAK1 complex.</p>
      <p>Our initial efforts to identify specific ubiquitin acceptor lysines on TRAF6 revealed that while we could detect reduced TRAF6 autoubiquitination in some cases, these reductions were not accompanied by reduced TRAF6 function. This was true even for TRAF6 K124, the recently identified acceptor site reported to be essential simultaneously for TRAF6 autoubiquitination and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lamothe1">[22]</xref>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004064.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). By taking the dramatic step of mutating all lysines on TRAF6 to arginine in order to ablate all potential acceptor sites, we were forced to acknowledge certain caveats. First, some residues may be important for protein stability. While lysine ablation did not affect expression of N-terminal TRAF6&#x394;K(1-358), full-length &#x394;K protein expression was dramatically reduced. Regardless, any loss in protein stability was not sufficient to affect the signaling functions examined. Second, we may have inadvertently abrogated the capacity of TRAF6 to undergo other lysine-dependent modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, or K48-linked degradative ubiquitination. Published data indicates a negative regulatory mechanism for TRAF6 via IFN&#x3B3;-induced K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Takayanagi2">[30]</xref>. Our observation that lysine ablation in the N-terminus of TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) leads to increased NF&#x3BA;B and AP-1 activity may indicate interference with a similar type of negative regulation. Additional efforts are required to fully characterize the effects of this mutational pattern on TRAF6 protein stability and turnover.</p>
      <p>Cumulatively, our findings regarding the genetic dispensability of TRAF6 autoubiquitination lead us to a revised model for TRAF6-mediated activation of the NF&#x3BA;B and MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Upon receptor engagement, K63-linked ubiquitin chains are affixed to TRAF6, at least in part through the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the TRAF6 RING finger domain. Both TRAF6 autoubiquitination and the TRAF6 RING finger domain appear dispensable for recruitment of the TAB1-TAB2-TAK1 complex. Previous reports indicate this interaction to be dependent on the ability of the TAB2 ubiquitin-binding domain to attach to K63-linked ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Kanayama1">[17]</xref>, suggesting an unidentified factor &#x201C;X&#x201D;, which interacts with TRAF6 independently of autoubiquitination, may serve as the binding partner for TAB2. At the same time, recruitment of TAK1 to TRAF6 is insufficient for TAK1 activation, which specifically requires TRAF6 RING finger activity. An additional unknown factor &#x201C;Y&#x201D; may be indicated, in this case to serve as a substrate(s) for TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination. Upon being ubiquitinated, factor &#x201C;Y&#x201D; would promote TAK1 phosphorylation, leading to MAPK and IKK&#x3B1;/&#x3B2; activation. TRAF6-mediated activation of the IKK&#x3B1;/&#x3B2; complex is only partially dependent on TAK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Shim1">[31]</xref>, but exhibits an absolute requirement for the regulatory component IKK&#x3B3; (NEMO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Rudolph1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Yamaoka1">[33]</xref>.

      <p>Recent efforts by various groups have identified additional targets of TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, including IRF-7 downstream of TLRs 7&#x2013;9 and LMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Kawai1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Ning1">[35]</xref>, IRF-5 downstream of TLRs 7 and 9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Balkhi1">[36]</xref>, NRIF, TrkA and TrkB, associated with NGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Geetha1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Geetha2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Jadhav1">[38]</xref>, and RIP2 and NEMO downstream of NOD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Abbott1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Yang1">[39]</xref>. Intriguingly, in the IL-1R pathway, it has recently been demonstrated that IRAK-1, which interacts with TRAF6 through a TRAF6 interaction motif, is modified by K63-linked ubiquitination in a TRAF6 RING finger-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Conze1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Windheim1">[41]</xref>. Further, it has been shown that NEMO contains a K63-specific ubiquitin-binding domain, required for IL-1-mediated IKK activation, which mediates interaction with ubiquitinated IRAK-1, but not ubiquitinated TRAF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Conze1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Windheim1">[41]</xref>. Examining our data in this context suggests that IRAK-1 and TRAF6 ubiquitination may be redundant, or that recruitment of TAK1 via TAB2/3 ubiquitin-binding may be mediated through ubiquitination of IRAK-1 (and/or one of the alternative TRAF6 targets listed above) rather than TRAF6. TRAF6 autoubiquitination may, in fact, be required in the absence of alternative ubiquitin substrates, or in other signaling systems lacking robust redundancy. Crosstalk between multiple TRAF6-associated scaffolding systems, specifically TRAF6-IRAK-NEMO in the IL-1R/TLR pathway and TRAF6-p62 in the atypical PKC pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Moscat1">[42]</xref>, may also create redundancies which obviate TRAF6 autoubiquitination. Further, while we have focused here on TRAF6-mediated activation of the TAK1 pathway, it should be noted that the kinase MEKK3 governs an alternate TRAF6-dependent signaling pathway, for which the role of TRAF6 autoubiquitination remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Huang1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we have undertaken a limited survey of the ever-expanding array of signaling pathways serviced by TRAF6. Assessment of the physiologic role of TRAF6 autoubiquitination may require cell-type specific examination of signals emanating from TLRs, NLRs, additional TNFRSF members, TGF&#x3B2;R, IL-17R and IL-25R, and others. However, our data demonstrate that TRAF6 autoubiquitination is clearly dispensable for TRAF6 function in two key signaling pathways, and suggest that TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination instead targets multiple relevant protein substrates during activation. Hopefully these findings will contribute specifically to defining the mechanism of TRAF6 function, and generally to elucidating the role of non-conventional ubiquitination in signal transduction.</p>
